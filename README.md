## A mathematician who hacks for a living.

Welcome to my github profile, please do read my description, and hopefully find anything useful.

A friend of mine once described this place as a basket of half eaten apples, as many things are started,
and rarely I finish them on my own.

It's not for a lack of trying, but I'm trying harder now.
